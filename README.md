## Data Set Description:

Title : Algerian Forest Fires Dataset

Link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Algerian+Forest+Fires+Dataset++

The dataset includes 122 instances data of regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria.

The period from June 2012 to September 2012. The dataset includes 13 attribues and 1 output attribue (class)

## Feature Reduction

**LDA:** Linear Discriminant Analysis, or LDA for short, is a predictive modeling algorithm for multi-class classification. It can also be used as a dimensionality reduction technique, providing a projection of a training dataset that best separates the examples by their assigned class.

**PCA:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation that converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables. PCA is the most widely used tool in exploratory data analysis and in machine learning for predictive models

## Classification Model

**SVM:** The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.


**Descion Tree:** Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.


**Naive Bayes:** Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
